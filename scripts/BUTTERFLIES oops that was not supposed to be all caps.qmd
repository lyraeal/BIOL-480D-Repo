OK note to self, you need to save the file every time before running it I think. the errors that appear if you don't are incredible

```{r setup chunk}

# libraries: 
library(tidyverse) 
library(ggplot2)

```

```{r data overview i}

# loading in the dataset
dat = readxl::read_xlsx("../files/ButterflyNIRData.xlsx")

head(dat)
```

```{r data overview ii}
# genus dat obtained like so: 
dat = dat %>% 
  mutate(genus = str_match(gsub("_", " ", dat$Species), "([A-Z,a-z]*) ")[,2]) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

# data about the butterfly
head(dat)[,c(1:2, 11, 24)]
```

### Other variables in the dataset

#### Predictor variables:

```{r data overview iii}

dat = dat %>% 
  mutate(temp.range = temp.max - temp.min)

# predictor var = different climactic measurements
head(dat)[,c(3:11, 25)]
```

|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Vis      | the mean reflectance in the visible range (UV+VIS) |
| Nir      | the mean reflectance in the near-infared range     |

### PCA

this is the part where he creates the pca we should prob also talk about our hypothesis here, cause i think it would be a good idea to explain why we're using a pca, and what exactly we're trying to measure.

\[elaborate explanation incoming\]

```{r that thing julian is doing with pcas}

cbind(dat[1:5], rob.zscore(dat[6:10]))


```

### heading tbd

maybe a section with qualitative predictions: like some figures! :D

```{r i loaded in ggplot2 earlier so we gotta use it right?? right????}


```

### Models

this is the part where we test different models?

```{r there will be an r chunk here, it's just a wip right now}


```

### Model strength

this is the part where we do AIC comparisons

```{r i promise there will be aic stuff here soon}


```

### Model fit

this is the part where we use DHARMA or however it's capitalized to look at residuals and model fit

```{r qqplot placeholder yum}


```
