## Study overview

Our group was interested in analyzing an ecological data set, since we have backgrounds in environmental field work. So for our project, we decided to work with a dataset called *Data for butterfly near-infrared adaptation research* which we found on **Dryad**. We decided on this dataset because it seemed to have many climate variables that could lead to model comparisons with different combinations of predictors. 

The dataset was collected by Kang et al. (Kang, Changku; Lim, Sehyuk; Lee, Won Young; Choi, Yunki; Stuart-fox, Devi; Huertas, Blanca).

This dataset was collected with the goal of determining whether butterfly light reflectance is impacted by climate variables. To accomplish this, the researchers photographed 343 European butterfly species from the Natural History Museum of London and measured both Visible (VIS) and Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of different body regions.

When possible, they photographed two of each species and averaged the reflectance values, for a sample size of 684 specimens overall. This sample size could skew our results because it did not account for a lot of intraspecific variation, and took 1-2 butterflies to be representative of an entire climatic niche. On a positive note, the 343 species photographed was a large sample size for focusing on interspecific variation, since this covered 70% of all butterfly species in Europe.

## Data overview

Let's take a quick look at the dataset! Each of the rows is a species of butterfly, and then there are several predictor variables and response variables that the researchers looked at.

```{r data overview i}

# loading in the dataset
dat = readxl::read_xlsx("../files/ButterflyNIRData.xlsx")

head(dat)
```

We also created a column that extracted the genus of each species. Here's some of the data we have on each butterfly species.

We have the species and genus of each butterfly, which are *character* data, and the size of the entire wing was measured as an additional variable to consider, and was averaged within a species.

| Variable | Description                                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Species  | species name                                                   |
| Size     | size (cm2) measured from one side of the both fore-/hind-wings |
| Genus    | genus of species                                               |

```{r data overview ii}
# genus dat obtained like so: 
dat = dat %>% 
  mutate(genus = str_match(gsub("_", " ", dat$Species), "([A-Z,a-z]*) ")[,2]) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

# data about the butterfly
head(dat)[,c(1, 11, 24)]
```

We have a bunch of climactic predictor variables in the dataset as well!

The climate variables were collected from the CLIMBER dataset and WorldClim data, and were averaged across the geographic distribution of each species. The data class for all variables here is *numeric*

#### Predictor variables

| Variable          | Description                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| temp.mean         | mean annual temperature (°C) across a species' range          |
| temp.min          | mimimum annual temperature (°C) across a species' range       |
| temp.max          | maximum annual temperature (°C) across a species' range       |
| precip.mean       | mean of annual precipitation sum (mm) across a species' range |
| SolarRadi         | mean solar irradiation (kJ m-2 day-1) across a species' range |
| WaterVapor        | water vapour pressure (kPa)                                   |
| Isothermality     | isothermality                                                 |
| PrecipSeasonality | precipitation seasonality                                     |
| TempSeasonality   | temperature seasonality                                       |

```{r data overview iii}

# predictor var = different climactic measurements
head(dat)[,c(3:11)]
```

#### Response variables

Then, you'll see below that each response column is a combination of 3 separate parts.

| Variable | Description           |
|----------|-----------------------|
| B        | basal wing            |
| E        | entire wings          |
| T        | abdomen-thorax region |
| Dors     | dorsal wings          |
| Vent     | ventral wings         |

![](images/butterfly_loc.png)

| Variable | Description                                        |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Vis      | the mean reflectance in the visible range (UV+VIS) |
| Nir      | the mean reflectance in the near-infared range     |

```{r data overview iv}

# response var set 1 = vis
head(dat)[,12:17]

# response var set 2 = nir
head(dat)[,18:23]
```

## Further context for variables

The reflectance of butterfly wings in the **Visual (VIS)** range plays an important role in both **camouflage and thermoregulation**; the color of butterflies helps them to both blend into their surroundings or scare off predators, and to absorb or reflect a certain amount of heat from solar energy. However, 50% of solar energy extends beyond visual wavelengths to the Near-infrared (NIR). In contrast to VIS range reflectance, **NIR** reflectance plays no role in camouflage, suggesting it could play a **more important role in thermoregulation**.

Additionally, certain butterfly body regions are more important for thermoregulation than others. Specifically, the **basal region** of the wings and the **thorax/abdomen** region of the body **conduct heat** to the flight muscles.

Butterflies also regulate their body temperature by opening and closing their wings to expose or hide themselves from sunlight. **Dorsal basking** exposes the top part of their wings to sun, and plays an important role in **warming up**. Butterflies also close their wings tightly to shield themselves from solar radiation and **cool down**, which exposes the bottom, or **ventral** part of their wings.

Below is one graph that explores a potential relationship between a climate variable (temp.mean) and the Visual reflectance of different butterfly body regions. This visualization supports the ecological hypothesis that Dorsal reflectance may be more important for warming while Ventral reflectance may be more important for cooling: you can see that the blue Dorsal regions generally have lower reflectance values since darker colors aid in absorbing heat, while pink Ventral regions have higher reflectance values since this may help butterflies cool off more efficiently by reflecting more sunlight when closing their wings. Additionally, Basal (B) and Thorax-Abdomen (T) regions are more involved in thermoregulation than the rest of the wing. This could be why the dashed lines for Entire wing (E) have lower slopes than the solid line VentralT and VentralB; changes in the climate variable of mean temperature have a stronger impact on the B and T regions, which are important in thermoregulation, than the E region.

```{r intro graph, warning = F}
dat %>%
  pivot_longer(12:23,
               names_pattern = "([A-Z]i[a-z])([A-Z][a-z]*[A-Z])",
               names_to = c(".value", "location")) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = temp.mean, y = Vis, color = location)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.35, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = location), method = "lm", size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("DorsB" = "blue","VentB" = "magenta3",
               "DorsT" = "steelblue1","VentT" = "maroon4",
               "DorsE" = "royalblue1","VentE" = "hotpink2")) +
  scale_linetype_manual(
    values = c("DorsB" = "solid", "DorsT" = "solid",
               "DorsE" = "dashed", "VentB" = "solid",
               "VentT" = "solid", "VentE" = "dashed")) +
  theme(legend.key.width = unit(2, "cm")) +
  labs(x = "Mean Temperature (C)", y = "VIS Reflectance")

```

This visualization provided evidence that made us want to test for more differences in body region reflectance and the impact that different climate variables have on this variation. For simplicity, we decided to focus on the body regions of Basal wing, Thorax, and Entire wing as our predictors of reflectance variation, rather than splitting these into Ventral and Dorsal as well. We hoped that we would still get significant results, since we hypothesized that Basal and Thorax regions would respond more strongly to climate variables than the Entire wing since they are more important in thermoregulation.

#### Hypothesis

Therefore, **different climatic pressures could cause variation in reflectance values for different butterfly body regions**, or in other words, we think the BET (basal, entire, abdomen / thorax) regions might reflect light differently depending on the typical climactic conditions that each species might be exposed to.

**So then, how do the different body regions (B, E, and T) respond to different climate conditions and do they do so differently from one another?**

## Data manipulation

To prepare the data for analysis, we **added a column for butterfly genus** by isolating the first word of the "Species" column variables. This **allowed us to include genus as a random effect variable** in our model to account for variation that may result from genetic relationships. (we did this earlier :))

Additionally, our data currently groups together the dorsal and ventral sides with basal, entire, and abdomen / thorax (BET). However, we wanted to look only at the interaction between BET with the climactic variables, so we needed to separate out the dorsal and ventral into its own column, and BET into its own columns.

To do this, we used the **pivot_longer** function to alter the columns so that instead of having twelve different response variable columns for NIR / VIS reflectance for Dorsal / Ventral side for the B / T / E body regions (ex: VisDorsT), we had one reflectance column for NIR, one reflectance column for VIS, one column denoting whether the body region was Dorsal or Ventral, and one column denoting whether the body region was B, T, or E. This **allowed us to generate a model where the body region type (B, E, or T) could be used as a predictor variable for NIR and VIS reflectance**.

```{r long dat}

# separating out dorsal / ventral and B / E / T
longdat = dat %>%
  pivot_longer(12:23,
               names_pattern = "([A-Z]i[a-z])([A-Z][a-z]*)([A-Z])",
               names_to = c(".value", "dorvent", "BET"))

longdat[,c(1, 13:16)] %>% head(5)

```

**So now let's run the model!** Our two response variables will be Vis and Nir, the reflectance on the UV / visual spectrum, and the infrared spectrum respectively. We'll be doing indendent models for each of these, so let's go through vis first.

For our global model (aka our model with what we think is the maximum predictors and interactions that the model should have, we decided to look at 4 predictor variables: solar radiation, mean precipitation, water vapor pressure, and isothermality).

These are climate variables that have large implications for butterfly life and wing reflectance. Temperature mean and isothermality both have to do with temperature regulation. Mean precipitation and water vapor both have to do with moisture regulation, which we hypothesize are connected to wing area and general reflectance. We also expect solar radiation to impact reflectance directly.

```{r model attempt 1}

global_mod_vis = lme4::lmer(Vis ~ BET*SolarRadi + BET*precip.mean + BET*WaterVapor + BET*Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = longdat, na.action = "na.fail")

```

When running the model, we immediately ran into a warning that our predictor variables are on different scales, and to accommodate for this, we decided to convert all our values to z-scores so they could be on similar scales.

Since our data is not normally distributed, we did a robust z-score.

```{r z-score}

jull_rob.zscore <- function(df){
  mad.cols <- mad.temp <- med.cols <- c()
  z.score <- data.frame()
  for(i in 1:length(colnames(df))){
    for(j in 1:length(df[,i])){
      mad.temp[j] <- abs(as.numeric(df[j,i]) - median((df[,i])))
    }
    mad.cols[i] <- median((mad.temp))
    med.cols[i] <- median(as.numeric(df[,i]))
  }
  for(i in 1:length(colnames(df))){
    for(j in 1:length(df[,i])){
      z.score[j,i] <- (0.6745*(df[j,i]-med.cols[i]))/mad.cols[i]
    }
  }
  colnames(z.score) <- colnames(df)
  rownames(z.score) <- rownames(df)
  return(z.score = z.score)
}

zscore_dat = cbind(longdat[c(1, 12:16)], jull_rob.zscore(as.data.frame(longdat)[2:11]))

zscore_dat %>% head(5)

```

## UV / Visual reflectance model

Now that we can actually fit our model, let's take a look at the aic scores! We're using a function called `dredge()` which is from the `MuMIn` package. This essentially takes a *global model* that has your maximum predictors and interactions, and then randomly drops them until it finds every combination smaller than the model you have.

So assuming your model looked like this: `response ~ pred1 + pred2*pred3`, then `dredge()` can return the AIC scores of the following models:

-   `response ~ pred1 + pred2*pred3`
-   `response ~ pred1 + pred2 + pred3`
-   `response ~ pred2*pred3`
-   `response ~ pred2 + pred3`
-   `response ~ pred1 + pred2`
-   `response ~ pred1 + pred3`

```{r vis aic scores, warning = FALSE}

global_mod_vis = lme4::lmer(Vis ~ BET*SolarRadi + BET*precip.mean + BET*WaterVapor + BET*Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = zscore_dat, na.action = "na.fail")

aic_score_vis = MuMIn::dredge(global_mod_vis, beta = "none")

aic_score_vis %>% arrange(AICc) %>% head(3)

```

And the model best chosen by our AIC test is this one! We are including solar radiation, isothermality, mean temperature, and all of the interactions between those and BET.

```{r vis aic-chosen model}

aic_mod_vis = zscore_dat %>% 
  lme4::lmer((Vis) ~ BET*SolarRadi + BET*Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = ., na.action = "na.fail")

aic_mod_vis %>% car::Anova()

```

Using the dredged model (and omitting the unecessary parameters), we were able to test how well the model fit the data using the DHARMa package.

```{r residuals on vis aic mod}

DHARMa::testDispersion(DHARMa::simulateResiduals(aic_mod_vis))

DHARMa::simulateResiduals(aic_mod_vis, n = 1000, plot = TRUE)

```

Well clearly, these aren't the greatest model fits. So from here we wanted to see if there were any models we could fit with different distributions that may improve things.

So far we have been using normal distributions to do everything and the last DHARMa reading was very clearly pretty terrible.

As you can see, the distribution of `Vis` is skewed left, and both the `sqrt()` and the `log()` transformed versions look a lot better! We decided to try a model that tries transforming them like that.

We also tried a glm with a gamma distribution and a log link.

```{r vis hist}

zscore_dat$Vis %>% hist(main = "no transformation on Vis")
zscore_dat$Vis %>% sqrt %>% hist(main = "sqrt transformation on Vis")
zscore_dat$Vis %>% log %>% hist(main = "log transformation on Vis")

```

```{r creating alt vis mods, warning = FALSE}

aic_mod_vis_log = zscore_dat %>% 
  lme4::lmer(log(Vis) ~ BET*SolarRadi + BET*Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = ., na.action = "na.fail")

aic_mod_vis_sqrt = zscore_dat %>% 
  lme4::lmer(sqrt(Vis) ~ BET*SolarRadi + BET*Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = ., na.action = "na.fail")

aic_mod_vis_glm = zscore_dat %>% 
  lme4::glmer((Vis) ~ BET*SolarRadi + BET*Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = ., na.action = "na.fail", family = Gamma(link = "log"))


```

To check the fit of the model, we're looking at AIC scores again!

Then we can compare the model with the best AIC to the residual plots we observed originally to see if there's any improvement!

```{r vis residuals check}

MuMIn::AICc(aic_mod_vis, aic_mod_vis_log, aic_mod_vis_sqrt, aic_mod_vis_glm)

DHARMa::simulateResiduals(aic_mod_vis, n = 1000, plot = TRUE)
DHARMa::simulateResiduals(aic_mod_vis_log, n = 1000, plot = TRUE)

```

It's still not great, but it looks a lot better!

## Infrared reflectance model

And now we repeat the process for the infrared data.

```{r nir model aic, warning = FALSE}

global_mod_nir = lme4::lmer(Nir ~ BET*SolarRadi + BET*precip.mean + BET*WaterVapor + BET*Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = zscore_dat, na.action = "na.fail")

aic_score_nir = MuMIn::dredge(global_mod_nir, beta = "none")

aic_score_nir %>% arrange(AICc) %>% head(3)

```

Our most optimal model here is the inclusion of solar radiation, isothermality, and mean temperature, but with only solar radiation and mean temperature interacting with BET.

creating alternate methods!

```{r nir hist}

zscore_dat$Nir %>% hist(main = "no transformation on Nir")
zscore_dat$Nir %>% sqrt %>% hist(main = "sqrt transformation on Nir")
zscore_dat$Nir %>% log %>% hist(main = "log transformation on Nir")

```

```{r nir alt models, warning = FALSE}

aic_mod_nir = zscore_dat %>% 
  lme4::lmer((Nir) ~ BET*SolarRadi + Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = ., na.action = "na.fail")

aic_mod_nir_log = zscore_dat %>% 
  lme4::lmer(log(Nir) ~ BET*SolarRadi + Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = ., na.action = "na.fail")

aic_mod_nir_sqrt = zscore_dat %>% 
  lme4::lmer(sqrt(Nir) ~ BET*SolarRadi + Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = ., na.action = "na.fail")

aic_mod_nir_glm = zscore_dat %>% 
  lme4::glmer((Nir) ~ BET*SolarRadi + BET*Isothermality + BET*temp.mean + (1|genus) + (1|dorvent) - 1, 
             data = ., na.action = "na.fail", family = Gamma(link = "log"))

```

Here it looks like the log transformed data is more skewed than either alternative, but the model still fit the best according to the AIC!

```{r nir residuals check}

MuMIn::AICc(aic_mod_nir, aic_mod_nir_log, aic_mod_nir_sqrt, aic_mod_vis_glm)

DHARMa::simulateResiduals(aic_mod_nir, n = 1000, plot = TRUE)
DHARMa::simulateResiduals(aic_mod_nir_log, n = 1000, plot = TRUE)

```

## Final Results + plots!

```{r final vis models}

aic_mod_vis_log %>% car::Anova()
aic_mod_vis_log %>% summary %>% coefficients()

```

```{r final nir models}

aic_mod_nir_log %>% car::Anova()
aic_mod_nir_log %>% summary %>% coefficients()

```

```{r some plots}

  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") + 
  labs(x = "Mean temp", y = "UV / Visual reflectance", color = "Location") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(begin = 0.1, end = 0.7) +

  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12))

  geom_point(aes(color = BET)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(color = BET)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") + 
  labs(x = "Mean temp", y = "Infrared reflectance", color = "Location") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(begin = 0.1, end = 0.7) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) 

longdat[,c(1:2, 8, 14:16)] %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Isothermality, y = Vis)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(y = "UV / Visual reflectance") +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) 

longdat[,c(1:2, 8, 14:16)] %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Isothermality, y = Nir)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(y = "Infrared reflectance") +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) 

```

So what does this tell us?

Essentially temperature mean both has a significant interaction with the different parts of the butterfly's body that affects the infrared reflectance. This interaction also exists when considering the UV radiation reflectance. In both cases, solar radiation and isothermality affected the different light reflectances significantly, just not differently between the different body parts. From both the plots and the coefficients, you can clearly see that the thorax is affected by temperature mean more than any of the other parts of the butterfly. This could indicate that this part of the butterfly is much more important for the ultimate heat regulation than the entire wing area, or even the basal wing area.
